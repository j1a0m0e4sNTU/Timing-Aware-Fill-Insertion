2.Type "make" in the command line, then you get an executable program, whose name is "cad"

How to use:
1.Put the program 'cad' in the circuit directory which contains circuit.config, circuit.cut, process.dat, rule.dat
2.usage:  ./cad config_file_name 
  note that config_file_name is the file name of config file, like 'circuit.config' 
  After execution, you would have a file named '*.fill' in current directory, in which all the fills should be inserted are shown
